# windyPlume 

windyPlume is a collection of Python scripts that can be used to calibrate images
of wind-affected volcanic plumes. For a full description of how the software
works see a) comments in code and b) manuscript by Snee et al. (in prep)

## Contents:

Script_2_Calibrate.py - This is the primary script, to be ran by the user.
                        Variables in the User-Input section are to be edited by
			the user.

calibrate_function.py - Function that performs the geometric calibration based on
                        Bombrun et al. (2018)

Calibrate_allTogether_function.py - Function that performs the calibration

calcInclination_function.py - Function to estimate the camera inclination (if it
                              is not known)

calibrateWind_function.py - Function to perform the wind correction to the
                            calibration

extractWeather_function.py - Function to extract the weather data from netCDF
                             files

getAllUncertainty_function.py - Function called by Script_2_Calibrate.py -
                                Performs the calubration for different values of
				input parameters corresponding to the ranges of
				their uncertainties

SabancayaExample.py - Version of Script_2_Calibrate used to analyse eruption of
                      Sabancaya volcano on 31/07/2018, as presented in Snee et
		      al. (in prep).

exampleData - Directory containing example data pertaining to the 31/07/2018
              eruption of Sabancaya presented in Snee et al. (in prep).

exampleData/Sabancaya2018/geopot.nc - NetCDF file containing geopotential data
                                      above Sabancaya volcano on 31/07/2028,
				      used for the wind calibration. Data
				      downloaded from
				      https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview

exampleData/Sabancaya2018/plume.jpg - Example of frame from video of eruption.
                                      The full video can be found as Supporting
				      Information to Snee et al. (in prep).

exampleData/Sabancaya2018/plumeParameters.csv - Datafile including the pixel
                                                coordinates of the top of the
						plume in each frame from the
						video of the eruption. File
						created using the PlumeTraP
						software (Simionato et al.,
						2022)

exampleData/Sabancaya2018/windHeight.csv - Output from windyPlume showing the
                                           plume height (a.s.l) (column 2) as a
					   function of time (s) (column 1)

exampleData/Sabancaya/wind.nc - NetCDF file containing geopotential data above
                                Sabancaya volcano on 31/07/2028, used for the
				wind calibration. Data downloaded from
				https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview

## Pre-requisites

windyPlume requires Python3 as well as the following modules:

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. scipy
4. math
5. netCDF4
6. datetime
7. sys
8. copy

These modules can be installed using pip:

$ pip install <packageName>

e.g.,

$ pip install numpy
