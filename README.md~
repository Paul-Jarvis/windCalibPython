# windyPlume 

windyPlume is a collection of Python scripts that can be used to calibrate images
of wind-affected volcanic plumes. For a full description of how the software
works see a) comments in code and b) manuscript by Snee et al.

## Contents:

Script_2_Calibrate.py - This is the primary script, to be ran by the user.
                        Variables in the User-Input section are to be edited by
			the user.

calibrate_function.py - Function that performs the geometric calibration based on
                        Bombrun et al. (2018)

Calibrate_allTogether_function.py - Function that performs the calibration

calcInclination_function.py - Function to estimate the camera inclination (if it
                              is not known)

calibrateWind_function.py - Function to perform the wind correction to the
                            calibration

extractWeather_function.py - Function to extract the weather data from netCDF
                             files

getAllUncertainty_function.py - Function called by Script_2_Calibrate.py -
                                Performs the calubration for different values of
				input parameters corresponding to the ranges of
				their uncertainties

## Instructions

### Pre-requisites

windyPlume requires Python3 as well as the following modules:
